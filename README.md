# EventApp

This document is the initial workplan that I will use as a guide to complete my e-portfolio and at the same time demonstrate my growth as a software developer during my years of studying at Southern New Hampshire University. The artifacts I have chosen will within the tree categories proposed by the capstone course which are: Software Design and engineering, Algorithms/Data Structures and Databases. 

- Software Design and engineering
For this first category as part of my final project, I decided to work with an artifact that was completed during CS-360 Mobile Architect & Programming. 
Artifact: Event tracking App – Built in Java and Android Studio. 

Enhancement plan: 
I submitted my final project for this application, and I recall, it was completed but the app was not fully functional. What I would like to do this time, it’s to transfer the app to a different language and create a web application instead of an android or mobile app. 

The web application will be built using JavaScript. By transferring the app to different computer language, I will demonstrate the skills gained using JavaScript but also its relationship with databases and the utilization of Visual Studio code as the IDE. 

By using web app development, web-based projects can function and behave just like mobile apps. Web apps prioritize dynamic interactions with users while still providing access through a network and the internet. The standard web development front-end and back-end technologies are used in web apps.
